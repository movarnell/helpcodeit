You can contribute at any level you wish. If you want to contribute something not listed in the issues page feel free to add your own issue, and we will approve or deny it based on the usefulness to the mission of the site. 
If you wish to add new pages make sure you use the template to keep the styling the same, and to keep the navbar uniform across the site.
