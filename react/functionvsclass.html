            <h2>How Should I Look at This?</h2>
            <p>These days React apps are mostly function components. They are easier to read, write, and test. They also
                perform better than class components.</p>
            <p>However, class components are still used in some cases. For example, if you work for a company with older
                React applications they may be written in a Class based style.</p>
            <h2>What is a Function Component?</h2>
            <p>A function component is a JavaScript function that accepts props and returns a React element. It is a
                simple way to write a component that only contains a render method and doesn't have its own state. It is
                also known as a stateless component.</p>
            <p>Modern React apps are almost exclusively written as function components. They are easier to read, write,
                and test. They also perform better than class components.</p>
            <h2>What is a Class Component?</h2>
            <p>A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component. It is a more complex way to write a
                component that has its own state and lifecycle methods. It is also known as a stateful component.</p>
            <p>It would be a good practice to focus on function components, but you may still need to work with class
                components in some cases.</p>
            <h2>What is the Difference Between a Function Component and a Class Component?</h2>
            <p>Below we will cover a basic layout for a function based component in React, then we will show the Class
                based component to contrast the two.</p>

            <p>First, let's look at a function based component. This example shows the <code>export default</code>
                portion at the end. It can be tagged in the beginning where the function delcaration is. In the comments
                for the code we show what that would look like as well:</p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-jsx">
                    import React from 'react';
                    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

                    // export default function App() {
                    function App() {
                        return (
                            <div className="App">
                                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                            </div>
                        );
                    }
                    // if exporting above you won't need this line
                    export default App;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>Now lets look at a Class based component. This example shows the <code>export default</code> portion at
                the end. It can be tagged in the beginning where the class delcaration is. In the comments for the code
                we show what that would look like as well:</p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-jsx">
                    import React from 'react';
                    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

                    // export default class App extends React.Component {
                    class App extends React.Component {
                        render() {
                            return (
                                <div className="App">
                                    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                                </div>
                            );
                        }
                    }
                    // if exporting above you won't need this line
                    export default App;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="mt-4">As you can see, the function based component is much easier to read and write. It is also
                easier to test. The class based component is more complex and has more code to write. It is also more
                difficult to test.</p>
            <h3>Why are Class Based Components Not Being Used?</h3>
            <p>Class based components are not being used because they are more complex and have more code to write. They
                are also more difficult to test.</p>
            <p>While they aren't depricated yet, they will be soon. It is a good idea to focus on function based
                components.</p>
