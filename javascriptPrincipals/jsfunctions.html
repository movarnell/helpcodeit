    <p>A function in JavaScript is like a little recipe that tells the computer exactly what to do. Imagine you have a recipe for making cookies. It tells you the ingredients, the steps to mix them, and how to bake them. Functions work the same way, but instead of cookies, they make code do something special!</p>
    
    <h2 class="p-1">What Is a Function?</h2>
    <p>A function is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. It's like a tiny computer program inside your main program. Let's learn how to create one!</p>

    <h2 class="p-1">How to Create a Function</h2>
    <p>Creating a function is like writing down a recipe. Here's an example of a simple function that says "Hello, World!" when it's called:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function sayHello() {
  alert('Hello, World!');
}</code></pre>
    <p>This code says, "Create a function named 'sayHello' and make it show a pop-up with the words 'Hello, World!' when it's used."</p>

    <h2 class="p-1">How to Use a Function</h2>
    <p>Once you have created a function, you can use it by calling its name followed by parentheses. Here's how you call the 'sayHello' function:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">sayHello();</code></pre>
    <p>When this line of code is run, it will make a pop-up appear that says 'Hello, World!'</p>

    <h2 class="p-1">Why Should You Use Functions?</h2>
    <p>Functions make your code neater and easier to read. They also let you reuse the same code many times without having to write it again and again. Imagine if you had to write down the whole cookie recipe every time you wanted to make cookies. That would be a lot of extra work!</p>

    <h2 class="p-1">Functions with Parameters: Giving Information to Functions</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, you want your function to do something specific with certain pieces of information. These pieces of information are called "parameters." Here's how you can create a function that takes two numbers and adds them together:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">function addNumbers(number1, number2) {
  var sum = number1 + number2;
  alert('The sum is ' + sum);
}

addNumbers(5, 3); // This will show a pop-up saying 'The sum is 8'</code></pre>
    <p>This code says, "Create a function named 'addNumbers' that takes two numbers, adds them together, and then shows a pop-up with the result."</p>

    <h2 class="p-1">Let's Practice!</h2>
    <p>Now you know what functions are, how to create them, how to use them, and why they're helpful. Try making your own functions and see what you can do with them. Remember, coding is all about experimenting and having fun!</p>

    <h2 class="p-1">Where can you 'Call' or Use Functions?</h2>
    <p>Functions can be called anywhere in your code. You can call them in the middle of a function, at the end of a function, or even inside another function. You can also call them from outside your code, like in the console or in a separate file.</p>
    <p>The flexibility of functions is one of their best features. You can use them in many different ways to make your code more powerful and easier to read.</p>
