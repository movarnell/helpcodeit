            <p>Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is met. Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.</p>
            <p>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
                <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
                <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
                <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
                <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col">

        <h2>JavaScript For Loop</h2>
        <p>The for loop has the following syntax:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    // code block to be executed
}</code></pre>
        <p>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</p>
        <p>Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.</p>
        <p>Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following example will print the numbers 0 to 4:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    console.log("The number is " + i);
}
//Output: The number is 0
//Output: The number is 1
//Output: The number is 2
//Output: The number is 3
//Output: The number is 4</code></pre>

        <h2>JavaScript While Loop</h2>
        <p>The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</p>
        <p>The while loop has the following syntax:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
            
}</code></pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following example uses a while loop to count the numbers 0 to 4:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">while (i &lt; 5) {
    console.log("The number is " + i);
    i++;
}
//Output: The number is 0
//Output: The number is 1
//Output: The number is 2
//Output: The number is 3
//Output: The number is 4</code></pre>
        <h2>JavaScript Do/While Loop</h2>
        <p>The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</p>
        <p>The do/while loop has the following syntax:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">do {
    // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
</code></pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following example uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">do {
    console.log("The number is " + i);
    i++;
}
while (i &lt; 5);
//Output: The number is 0
//Output: The number is 1
//Output: The number is 2
//Output: The number is 3
//Output: The number is 4</code></pre>
        <h2>JavaScript For/In Loop</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object.</p>
        <p>The for/in statement has the following syntax:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (variable in object) {
    // code block to be executed
}</code></pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following example loops through the properties of an object:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
    text += person[x];
}
//Output: JohnDoe25</code></pre>
        <h2>JavaScript For/Of Loop</h2>
        <p>The JavaScript for/of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.</p>
        <p>The for/of statement has the following syntax:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (variable of iterable) {
    // code block to be executed
}</code></pre>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following example loops through all the values of an iterable object (an array):</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
    text += x;
}
//Output: BMW, Volvo, Mini</code></pre>

<div class="row mt-5">
    <h1>Switch Statments</h1>
    <p>Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.</p>
    <p>This is the perfect solution for long, nested if/else statements.</p>
    <p>The switch statement evaluates an expression. The value of the expression is then compared with the values of each case in the structure. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.</p>
    <p>The switch statement is often used together with a break or a default keyword (or both). These are both optional:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The break keyword breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block. If break is omitted, the next code block in the switch statement is executed.</li>
        <li>The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match. There can only be one default keyword in a switch. Although this is optional, it is recommended that you use it, as it takes care of unexpected cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>In this example we use the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">let day;
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
    case 0:
        day = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 1:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        day = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        day = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        day = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        day = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        day = "Saturday";
}
//Output: Today is Saturday</code></pre>
    <h3>Common Code Blocks</h3>
    <p>Often when a switch statement is used, the cases share the same code blocks. In the example below, case 4 and 5 share the same code block, and 0 and 6 share another code block:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">let text;
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
    case 4:
    case 5:
        text = "Soon it is Weekend";
        break;
    case 0:
    case 6:
        text = "It is Weekend";
        break;
    default:
        text = "Looking forward to the Weekend";
}
//Output: Soon it is Weekend</code></pre>

        <h1 class="text-center">Which Loop to Use?</h1>
        <p class="lead fw-bolder">When to use a for loop:</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>When you know how many times the code should run</li>
            <li>When you want to run the code a specific number of times</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead fw-bolder">When to use a while loop:</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>When you do not know how many times the code should run</li>
            <li>When you want to run the code while a condition is true</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead fw-bolder">When to use a do/while loop:</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>When you want to run the code at least once - before the condition is tested</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead fw-bolder">When to use a for/in loop:</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>When you want to loop through the properties of an object</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="display-5">Looping Over Arrays</h2>
        <p>Looping over an array can be done in many ways. The most common ways to loop over an array in JavaScript are using a for loop and also a for in loop. The for loop is the most basic of all the loops in JavaScript. It loops over the elements of an array, assigning the current element to a variable. The for in loop is a little more complex. It loops over the properties of an object, assigning the current property to a variable. </p>
        <!-- Example of looping over an array of names-->
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>The following example loops over an array of names:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">const names = ["John", "Jane", "Jack", "Jill"];

for (let i = 0; i &lt; names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i]);
}
//Output: John, Jane, Jack, Jill</code></pre>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is met. Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.</p>
