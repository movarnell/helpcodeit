        <h4 class="mt-3">() => `Arrow Functions`</h4>
        </div>
    </div>
        <div class="row">
        <p>Arrow functions are a new way to write functions in JavaScript. They are more concise than traditional functions and they have a more intuitive syntax. Arrow functions are anonymous functions. They are called arrow functions because they use an arrow (=>) to define the function. Arrow functions are also called lambda functions.</p>
        <p>Arrow functions are always anonymous. They are used as callbacks and as arguments to other functions. They are also used as methods in objects.</p>
        <p>Even though arrow functions are anonymous, they can be assigned to variables. The variable can then be used to call the function.</p>
        <p>We use arrow functions as a way to keep a function from being called until it is needed. This is called lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation is a way to improve performance by only calling a function when it is needed.</p>
        <p>Arrow functions are also used to create functions that are called immediately. These functions are called immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs). IIFEs are used to create a function that is called immediately. This is useful when you want to create a function that is called immediately and then never again.</p>
        <p>Arrow functions are an update to Javascript that was made in ES6. Below we will talk about ways to use them, and provide examples.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <h1>Arrow Function Syntax</h1>
        <p>With a normal function you will have the function keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by the parameters, followed by the body of the function. With an arrow function you will have the parameters, followed by the arrow, followed by the body of the function.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of a normal function, immediately followed by the same function written as an arrow function.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            // Standard function declared with the function keyword.
            function add(a, b) {
                return a + b;
            }
            console.log(add(2, 3));
            // 5

            // The arrow function is the same as the normal function above.
            const add = (a, b) => {
                return a + b;
            }
            console.log(add(2, 3));
            // 5
        </code></pre>
        <p>As you can see, the arrow function is much more concise than the normal function. The arrow function is also easier to read.</p>
        <p>In the next example we will show how to use arrow functions as callbacks to prevent them from being called until they are needed.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
            const add = (a, b) => {
                return a + b;
            }
            const subtract = (a, b) => {
                return a - b;
            }
            const multiply = (a, b) => {
                return a * b;
            }
            const divide = (a, b) => {
                return a / b;
            }
            const calculate = (a, b, callback) => {
                return callback(a, b);
            }
            console.log(calculate(2, 3, add));
            // 5
            console.log(calculate(2, 3, subtract));
            // -1
            console.log(calculate(2, 3, multiply));
            // 6
            console.log(calculate(2, 3, divide));
            // 0.6666666666666666
        </code></pre>
        <p>To better understand the syntax of what each part of the arrow function is doing, let's break it down.</p>
        <p>The first part of the arrow function is the parameters. The parameters are the values that are passed into the function. In the example above, the parameters are a and b.</p>
        <p>The second part of the arrow function is the arrow. The arrow is used to define the function. The arrow is followed by the body of the function. The body of the function is the code that is executed when the function is called.</p>
        <p>The third part of the arrow function is the body of the function. The body of the function is the code that is executed when the function is called. In the example above, the body of the function is return a + b.</p>
        <h3>Usage of Arrow Functions</h3>
        <p>We have discussed how we use them and different useful things we can do with them. It is easy to think we should use them all the time. However, there are some cases where we should not use them.</p>
        <p>Arrow functions are not good for functions that are called often. They are not good for functions that are called often because they are slower than normal functions. This is because arrow functions are anonymous functions. They are called anonymous functions because they do not have a name. This means that they cannot be called directly. They must be assigned to a variable and then called using the variable.</p>
        <p>The time difference between an arrow function and a normal function is very small. However, if you are calling a function many times, the time difference can add up.</p>
        <p>It is important to the company you work for to lower costs, and for the user to have a good experience. This is why it is important to use arrow functions only when they are needed.</p>
