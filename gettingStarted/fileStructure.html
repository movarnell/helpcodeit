            <h2 class="lato-font">What is File Structure?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">
            File structure is the way that files are organized on a computer. It is important to understand file structure because it is the way that you will be able to access your files.
        </p>
    <h2 class="lato-font">What is a File?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">A file on a computer is like a digital container that holds information, such as text, images, videos, or programs. It's stored on a computer's hard drive or another storage device. Just like a physical file in a filing cabinet, it keeps specific pieces of information together under a unique name so you can find, open, and work with it easily.</p>
        <h2 class="lato-font">What is a Folder?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">A folder is a container for storing programs and files, similar to a folder in a file cabinet. Folders are often used to group and organize files and other folders. They are often used to organize files into manageable groups.</p>

        <h2 class="lato-font ">What is a Directory?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">A directory is a location for storing files on your computer. Directories are found in a hierarchical file system, such as Linux, MS-DOS, OS/2, and Unix. In a hierarchical file system, there is a main directory that contains all of the other files and directories. Essentially they operate as the same thing as a folder.</p>
        <h2 class="lato-font ">What is a Path?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">A path is a unique location to a file or a folder in a file system of an OS. A path to a file is a combination of / and alpha-numeric characters. A path to a folder/directory can be a combination of /, alpha-numeric characters, and special characters. A path can be absolute or relative.</p>
        <h2 class="lato-font ">What is an Absolute Path?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/). In other words,we can say that an absolute path is a complete path from start of actual filesystem from / directory.</p>
        <h2 class="lato-font ">What is a Relative Path?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">A relative path is a path relative to the current working directory. Relative paths make use of two special symbols, a dot (.) and a double-dot (..), which translate into the current directory and the parent directory. Double dots are used for moving up in the hierarchy. A single dot represents the current directory itself.</p>
        <h2 class="lato-font ">What is a Root Directory?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">The root directory, or root folder, is the top-level directory of a file system. The directory structure can be visually represented as an upside-down tree, so the term "root" represents the top level. All other directories within a volume are "branches" or subdirectories of the root directory.</p>
        <h2 class="lato-font ">What is a Home Directory?</h2>
        <p class="lato-font">A home directory is a file system directory on a multi-user operating system containing files for a given user of the system. The specifics of the home directory (such as its name and location) are defined by the operating system involved; for example, Linux uses /home/<username>, while macOS uses /Users/<username>.</p>
